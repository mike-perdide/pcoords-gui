Coding styles
=============

We follow PEP8 here, with an exception for the methods name, which are formatted
with camelCase.

Please read: http://bitesofcode.blogspot.fr/2011/10/pyqt-coding-style-guidelines.html

Ui filenames
------------
The ui filenames should reflect the fonction they are performing and the 
implemented class. For instance, the following names are valid:

 * find_file_dialog.py
 * display_graph_widget.py
 * main_window.py

PyQt4 signals
-------------

We're using new-style PyQt4 signals.
