Picviz Frontend
---------------

Frontend to perform parallel coordinates plot analysis: dig, scale, change axis order, correlate etc...

* Requires python bindings installed on the system
* Requires enough knowledge to use it without any documentation in the near future: I am focused on the library documentation for now
